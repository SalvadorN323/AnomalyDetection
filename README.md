Hello!

My name is Salvador Nunez and I am part of the Software Engineering (CSE-120) team CSE-313 working on the Automated Identification of Paste Visual Finish - Phase 2 capstone project.
Working alongside our client Morning Star and mentor Justus Sasse. 

This is a side project I have been working on for a couple weeks that aims to tackle their anomaly detection bonus feature. 

The main file to run is flask_model.py where it renders html templates of tomato paste images on one page and renders the results from using OpenCv for image processing and analysis on the other page.
